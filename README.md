## How to Run

Since this project uses static HTML files with a CDN for styling, no build process or package installation is required.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to start viewing the documentation.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Introduction and platform overview
- `auth.html`: User authentication and onboarding workflows
- `org.html`: Organization level management description
- `team.html`: Team administration reference
- `coach.html`: Features for coaches and trainers
- `player.html`: Player dashboard and profile management
- `admin.html`: Super Admin controls
- `public.html`: Public-facing pages

## Customization

The design uses Tailwind CSS utility classes. To modify the styling, edit the classes directly in the HTML files. The navigation logic is contained within the script tags in each file.
